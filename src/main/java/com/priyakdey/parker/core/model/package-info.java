/**
 * This package contains the core business models for the Parker application.
 * <p>
 * These models define the basic building blocks and abstractions
 * around which the Parker application is built. The models may include
 * entities like vehicles, parking spaces, charges, etc., and encapsulate
 * the domain-specific logic and constraints.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, {@link com.priyakdey.parker.core.model.Vehicle} might define the attributes
 * and behaviors of a vehicle in the parking system.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Use the classes in this package to construct and manipulate the state
 * of the parking system according to your specific requirements.
 * </p>
